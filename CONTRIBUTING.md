# Contributing guidlines

Thank you for contributing to Keychain Swift library. Feel free to submit a pull request if you have any issue or need help.

## Adding new functionality

Before submitting a pull request please note that this library is not a full featured wrapper around Keychain API. The purpose of this project is to do few things and do them well. There are many excellent [alternative solutions](https://github.com/evgenyneu/keychain-swift#alternative-solutions) that provide additional features to people who need them. This project, in contrast, is a single-purpose tool that sacrifices functionality in favor of the ease of use.
